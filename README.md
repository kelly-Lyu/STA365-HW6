This repository contains solutions for three Bayesian modeling questions:

1. **Q1**: Implement a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler for a location–scale \(t\)-norm–halfnorm–discrete-uniform specification, demonstrating trace plots and parameter inference.

2. **Q2**: Explore how varying sample sizes (\(n\)) affects inference on the degrees-of-freedom parameter nu by building a PyMC model and comparing posterior results.

3. **Q3**: Derive the posterior predictive distribution by integrating out the Gamma-distributed precision from a Normal likelihood, showing that the marginal distribution is Student \(t\).
